## Building

- `make dev` will produce only the variable font for testing during development.
- `make build` will produce static and variable fonts in all font file formats (.otf, .ttf, .woff, .woff2).
- `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)’s quality assurance tests.
- `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

Proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Action. You can find them at [https://tiktok.github.io/TikTokSans/](https://tiktok.github.io/TikTokSans/).
